# Scienaptic AI_Internship

# ðŸ“Š **Financial News Sentiment Analyzer â€” Scienaptic AI Internship Project**

This project analyzes daily financial news headlines to predict DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) stock market movements, built during an internship at **Scienaptic AI**.
It combines NLP techniques, sentiment analysis, and machine learning models to enable near realâ€‘time risk assessment for investment teams.
